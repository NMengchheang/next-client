1. Which code receives the API response?
# The response is received in createProduct â†’ res.json(), then handled in:
# - const newProduct = await createProduct(productData);
# - setProducts((prevProducts) => [newProduct, ...prevProducts]);
- This ensures the new product is displayed immediately.


For Style image
# If you want to display the whole image without cropping, you can use the (object-contain) property instead of (object-cover). This will ensure the entire image fits within the container.
# overflow-hidden: Ensures any overflow is hidden.
# rounded-t-lg: Applies rounded corners to match your card design.
* Next.js <Image> Component:
# fill: Makes the image fill the container.
# object-contain: Ensures the full image is shown without cropping, even if it means having empty space around it.


# this answer can update quantity cart-item.
